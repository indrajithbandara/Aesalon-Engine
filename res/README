The 'res' folder is for storing resources such as
textures and sounds. These are not included with
the engine itself for the reason that it would
bloat up the download for people who only want the
engine source code. You can get the assets from the
repo "Aesalon-Assets", download that repo and place
its content in this folder and you'll be all set.
