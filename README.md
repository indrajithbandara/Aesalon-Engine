# Aesalon Engine
Welcome to the Aesalon Game Engine project, an effort to build a lightweight,
fast and powerful 3D game engine in ANSI C using OpenGL (and later the next gen Vulkan API),
OpenAL, GLFW, GLEW, Sandford C Library and the Sandford Userspace Libraries.
Aesalon is built for GNU/Linux first with added support for \*BSD and Microsoft Windows later on.
